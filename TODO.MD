## What to do
-[x] Load pdf into memory
-[x] Add handling errors for pdf not found
-[x] Clone pdf and delete the unnecessary pages
-[] Save pdf to the same dir

I think i need to use the pdf dependency for extracting_pages instead of deleting them. But first i want to try deleting them from behing and check if it will increase performance.
